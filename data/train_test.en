however , I would ask you , in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community , to make representations , using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent , to the President and to the Governor of Texas , Mr Bush , who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person .
this is a pity , in a sense .
this is in the special interest of northern European regions .
another matter we would like to address , specifically from the point of view of industrial policy , is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services , electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet , when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds .
Mr President , I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that I am speaking for my colleague , Mrs Flautre , who followed this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who is unfortunately ill .
in conclusion , while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund , we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society .
in brief , I would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000-2006 , which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face .
regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States .
regarding their content , as you know , ladies and gentlemen of this House , they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but , at the same time , very passionately , as I understood her presentation just now .
in conclusion , with thanks for your understanding , Mr President , I should like to thank you , Mrs Schroedter , for the quality of your work and that of the committee , and to tell you that I am very pleased , apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines .
it is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas .
the situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions .
Mr President , Commissioner , as my time is limited , I shall get straight to the point .
the report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda .
competition yes , restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible .
however , since state aid forms the lion &apos; s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like , regardless of Mr Jonckheer &apos; s report , to say one more thing about it . it is certainly possible , indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating them in regional and environmental policy .
here , a region has , by its own efforts , created a means of marketing its own products .
the German Government &apos; s intervention to save the Holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy .
let me mention the latest examples we have seen : Holzmann , a company which receives considerable aid from the German Government ; sawmills in former East Germany ; and , especially , aid to shipyards .
the fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure .
because , if this is not the case , we will be faced with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market .
we would be changing the law to make it executable again , which is something I consider to be unacceptable .
there was no majority for this at the time .
the Commission report confirms that , with the exception of Germany , state aid to businesses is increasing .
the Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition .
Mr President , today &apos; s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market .
it is probably horrendous , especially in this particular raft of legislation , that there are confused rules , regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts .
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed .
there is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States .
but the Member States failed to cooperate .
in any case , this idea must be encouraged , and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community corpus iuris in the Treaties .
we need a public debate on this .
it is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the Union &apos; s financial interests has been put into effect in so few Member States .
a legislative act , a directive , in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility , and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective , may enable us to take a major step forwards , and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due haste .
the guidelines , as adopted by the Commission , are very limited because , instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance , they are providing a shopping list of possible measures , a shopping list which , as it fails to set priorities in ascending order , could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration .
I am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the EU , and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report , and also that the Directorate-General for Competition will be making information , both general and specific , publicly accessible via its website .
it must also cooperate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of data in good time , which is to say in time for the ninth report .
-LRB- The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m . -RRB-
it is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster .
Mr President , every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again .
next , reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old .
hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members .
I am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement .
but how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led ?
I would like to thank Mrs GrossetÃªte and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament .
in fact , I believe that things have been done by the Commission , but there is still more to do .
I have received 8 motions for resolution , in accordance with Rule 37 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , to close the present Commission statement .
Commissioner , I would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward , particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the European Union , in terms of the help that we can offer them .
we know full well that what you are doing , Commissioner , and that is , limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the provisional Objectives 2 or 5b .
we must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the Union . that , however , is another problem altogether .
there is certainly a need for European civil protection , and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters .
it is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this .
as the White Paper makes clear , the new authority must be a value-added structure .
rapid alert is there for food but not for feed .
standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have drawn to the attention of Mr Verheugen .
its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September .
Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that .
I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile .
if you feel that these sessions after a Commission statement are important , I would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them .
it acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency .
the question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness , the Dalai Lama &apos; s , proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair ?
like the honourable Member I have read the autobiography of the Dalai Lama .
it is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member .
it is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves .
clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification .
here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression .
this report , therefore , appears at a crucial time , on the eve of Mr Kinnock &apos; s reforms .
this has now been done .
we want more than that , however .
it groups them together and that is very important .
so far , the promises which have been made are still , however , to be fulfilled , especially where transparency is concerned .
second , the fight against fraud , mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened , firstly by creating a culture in which they can not thrive .
Parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules , administrative procedures and management practices .
he has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change .
what happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation ?
we recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working .
it would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind , with all the work organised on that basis .
firstly , there is the Commissioners &apos; individual responsibility .
this Parliament has often heard the desire to reform the Commission expressed , even by its Presidents .
up until now , the Commission &apos; s payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa .
do not listen to the report &apos; s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed .
most of the report is about financial control . that is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee .
that is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were .
these are what are missing .
secondly , all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted , and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement .
though time forbids me , Mr President , from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House , I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas .
as the House knows and has repeatedly said , the scale and scope of the Union &apos;s financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures .
we share the view , forcefully expressed by the Committee of Independent Experts , and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures .
I conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the House relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change .
I want to underline that point .
let me explain : it is true that the Israeli Government has delayed the third hand-over of West Bank territory to the Palestinian authorities .
will a free Palestine be a truly democratic state and , therefore , reliable as a partner in peace ?
of 47 states invited from all corners of the world , not one of them , however , is an Arab state included in the EU &apos; s Barcelona process .
all the foreign troops , including therefore the Syrian forces , must withdraw from Lebanon in accordance with Resolution 520 of the United Nations Security Council .
it is as if the Council had more than one face and two hands and what one signs up to , the other begrudges .
it applies to the fifteen Member States of the Union and provides for applicant countries , and possibly third countries also , to be associated with it .
with regard to the OISIN programme , and I am now referring to the 1997 budget year , projects were adopted for seminars , training , exchanges of officials , research and studies , and operational actions .
the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice hovers at the interface between the constituent elements of national sovereignty .
in other words , the stability of democracy is at stake if we discuss it .
whatever the Eurosceptics say , it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters .
having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers , I am optimistic and I am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months .
Mr President , Commissioner , the oral question tabled by Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ shows that this House is taking a firm stance . indeed , six months after the election of this new Parliament , we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe .
what action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum-seekers ?
racism in Ireland is endemic .
we must not and can not give the impression that the Union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an avalanche of refugees and economic migrants .
I would like to make three brief points .
the role of the Court of Justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete .
we voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument , together with an implementation committee , which would be attached to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be .
neither will it stop raising vital issues . for example , how much progress are you willing to make and what measures , legislative or otherwise , will you be taking to combat the scourge of trafficking in human beings , child pornography on the Internet , drugs , and organised crime ?
personally , I am pleased with some of the replies , for example , in relation to issues as sensitive as Schengen and the Europol Convention , which we hope will be reviewed , and I am pleased with the words of the Minister for Justice with regard to trying to bring them under the jurisdiction of the judicial authorities .
nevertheless , at the last Fisheries Council of 1999 , held on 16 and 17 December , the Member States involved in this area of fishing , namely France , Spain and Portugal , considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a TAC reduced from 5 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes , as the Commission proposed , was excessively cautious .
I do not know if you are aware , representatives of the Council of Ministers , of your responsibility over these last few years , and in 2000 as well , for the plight of the families who live on anchovy fishing in the north of the Iberian Peninsular .
this failure is illustrated by the fact that after an entire war that was waged to put an end to ethnic cleansing , we now have ethnic cleansing from the opposite side .
Mr Seixas da Costa , I totally agree with you .
Mr Crowley , with regard to the presidency &apos; s scope for supporting actions by non-governmental organisations , particularly those which attempt to resolve the problems faced by the homeless , I would like to say that such initiatives are welcome , and we are very much open to the possibility of supporting them .
we know what the problem is : instability on the markets as the result of speculation .
as I have said , we are not opposed to such a study .
I would point out that the European Union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and , like Mr DÃ©sir and several other speakers , I feel that the European Union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect .
however , the people are fighting back , as demonstrated by their reaction during the incredible Seattle Summit . the leaders of the world , headed unfortunately by the European Commission , rushed forward submissively , hoping that their docility at the feet of the master of the world , Mr Clinton , would be enough to ensure them the scraps from the table .
it is perhaps not by chance that the Conservative benches have emptied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western Europe over recent decades .
the Union should make a tax pact , which any countries could initially be party to .
in addition - and this has also been mentioned already , for example by Mr GasÃ²liba I BÃ¶hm , but also by others - there is a need for more supervision .
-LRB- Applause -RRB-
Mr SchÃ¼ssel is a man with an honourable record in European politics .
when the talks between the SPÃ and ÃVP broke down , the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FPÃ for their support .
I would also like to say that the position of the fourteen states emanating from the Council was justified , as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the European Union , meaning this is also a matter for the Council and not merely an internal affair of Austria &apos; s .
European democracy and Austrian democracy should not receive any lessons from anybody and certainly not from a Belgian Government that embraces corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and that appointed the leader of such a corrupt party , which was condemned by the court , to the post of European Commissioner .
the vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
to explain in a clear and coherent way how the Commission applies , and intends to apply , the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reasoned and coherent principles .
we have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys ; and of course , we apply it in several different environmental areas .
the Commission ?
it is already established within the Community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with Parliament .
we will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform , as the Council has resolved to do , and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny .
it is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification .
the Union can not be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values , whether it comes down to an economic free trade area , or whether , on the other hand , it has a greater ambition : the desire to be a supranational union , in ways that have yet to be defined , that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world .
however , politics exacts its revenge , and having been thrown out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda , it comes back in , as a matter of fact , through a door , and through the front door in the case of Austria , since a party is entering the Austrian Government which seems to represent a return to intolerance , xenophobia and forms of racism .
the issues to be dealt with at this Intergovernmental Conference are exceptionally sensitive .
if the limits are exceeded because of a one-sided quest for effectiveness , then the legitimising basis of the European Union will suffer .
the Commission &apos; s current President , Mr Prodi , and the High Representative , Mr Solana , have put forward ideas along the same lines .
my colleagues , Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken , somewhat sceptically , about some aspects of the matter in hand .
this has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about .
Scotland , with a population of 5 million , has eight seats in this House at the moment ; Denmark and Finland , with the same population , have sixteen .
this will not be a matter of chance , since , let me repeat , I feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the European Union .
all the more reason for Members of the European Parliament , Ministers , Commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens , to public debate .
these are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments .
we want to achieve a completely flexible solution .
we have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from EEC to EC to EU .
I assume that , although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known , their number will most definitely not be low .
I think that , with this report , we are , once again , one step closer to the realisation of the internal market .
Mr President , thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail .
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner , who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate , to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings .
the second important problem is that we have been asked for payments , the donors have made commitments and , obviously , we are the only ones actually paying .
as of 9 February , there will be something known as the Kosovo Transitional Council , which will comprise representatives of the political parties , the minorities and civil society , and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament .
I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on SAVE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading .
save is the only Community-wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy .
I have to say , like motherhood , although we all support it , sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy-saving .
it lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us .
however , Madam President , these considerations must not hide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow , and which the Socialists will vote in favour of , will put in place one of the European Union &apos; s most important programmes .
all that remains for me to say is : time to get down to business .
where would Europe &apos; s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture ?
many people in my country say they see British culture being under threat , for example , from Portugal , from Germany , from Finland , for heaven &apos; s sake .
a pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap .
secondly , because it can promote recycling , which is important .
I would therefore urge my colleagues not to support Amendment No 38 of the Christian Democrats and Amendment No 45 of some of the socialists .
each year , there are between 8 and 9 million vehicles scrapped within the European Union .
we know that in the Netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end-of-life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and breadth of the European Union .
I see no reason why licensing arrangements can not be organised across Europe for collection centres to scrap the 8 to 9 million vehicles which are disposed of within the European Union on an annual basis .
I commend Mr Florenz , Mr Lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs .
I therefore find it incomprehensible and very curious to see amendments from members of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , the objectives of which are to weaken the environmental requirements and significantly reduce car manufacturers &apos; liability .
whatever system is adopted , ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer .
there are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved .
two important questions have arisen in this regard . yes , there are in fact more than two questions , but I want to mention just two of the most important .
and secondly : are we reducing the European car industry &apos; s competitiveness by means of the present proposal ?
do we imagine , then , that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive ? no .
what kind of requirements do you think our children and grandchildren and future legislators are going to make of cars ?
they will not represent an insurmountable cost for the European car industry .
if we assume that , on average , a car has a life of eleven years , do Members , indeed does anyone , believe that we should wait for eleven years before we get to grips with this problem ?
these splendid cars do not constitute waste .
that is why I voted in favour of the amendments .
when it comes to pollution , like sin , we are all against it , but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good .
this goes against the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this Union .
.
beyond this , we have concerns that the `` flexibility &apos;&apos; or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present .
what are the values of the Belgian Socialist Party , which only goes from paedophilia scandals to corruption scandals , via Vandam and Agusta ?
at the moment it seems that the Haider Party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments .
I am voting in favour of it because it is inconceivable that the European Parliament , after its excellent political debate yesterday , should not adopt a stance on this matter .
for me there is no question of allowing them to develop and to flourish without fighting with all our might .
it is intolerable that the EU should involve itself in the formation of the government in a Member State .
for all these reasons I voted most decidedly in favour of the resolution before this House on the formation of the government in Austria .
in the meantime , they have been forming governments in German federal states .
I wonder on what point of order Mr Davies was speaking .
only this Parliament has emerged with some of its credit intact .
with eight out of ten people in Europe living in urban areas , it is right that we help our most deprived communities to tackle the all too familiar problems of deprivation , social exclusion , joblessness , crime , drug dependency and all the problems that are associated with that .
our most deprived urban neighbourhoods face a plethora of problems : high unemployment and often very low-paid precarious employment , poverty and social exclusion .
instead , communities in urban areas should be encouraged to present integrated action plans to tackle their specific urban problems , using EU resources as a value added to local actions .
I would like to see those actions extended to cover health and anti-discrimination , as provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty .
to increase the effectiveness of individual measures the number of projects for URBAN II has been limited to 50 .
in any case it is necessary to ensure that in small Member States in particular it is not only areas of large cities which are again in receipt of the support .
the Member States do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately .
leader must now move into the implementation phase .
the programme has been extremely successful in Ireland , as indeed I know it has been successful in other countries .
equal is a very difficult programme because it attempts to combine so many old programmes and yet aims to view them in a different light , doing so with less money than was available in the previous funds .
Mr President , Commissioners , I greatly welcome the possibilities for increased trans-European cooperation under INTERREG , but my concern is that the proposal offers fewer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas .
nonetheless , there are many maritime areas between which links are already established .
finally , it is to be hoped that greater coordination will be sought between the INTERREG initiative and the existing Community programmes , which are significant for external policy , as a vector for greater integration and for the joint drafting of programmes .
third point : specific measures in favour of some social groups - some speakers mentioned them - women , but also immigrants and refugees , must be envisaged .
we need specific proposals , both for legislation and for action programmes associated with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair societies .
I too wholeheartedly regret this situation .
although her identity was noted and her position as a Member of the European Parliament was very apparent , she was still held in custody all day .
-LRB- Parliament gave its assent -RRB-
Mr President of the Commission , you have represented and defended the European Parliament time and again over recent weeks .
we are breaking new ground and doing so in complex circumstances .
that could convince people that Europe , in its governance , is not something run exclusively from Brussels , which concentrates and soaks up more powers , more decisions , more authority .
secondly , we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , your inspiring speech , Mr Prodi , has quite won me over .
this is the keynote idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication , Mr Prodi , but which is unfortunately not there .
you dare not even call a spade a spade , but instead hide behind pseudo-trendy language by using the term ` governance &apos; for what is nothing more than federal , autocratic , centralised government .
yet you do not indicate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this .
we must show them that we intend to use the next five years to help them join the rich regions by promoting the less favoured regions using reasonable means .
what your texts do not make apparent is the extent to which these major , high-minded objectives are compatible with the resources that the Commission intends to deploy .
Mr Prodi , you do not know what you are talking about .
you must not allow yourself to be distracted by the sole issue of enlargement , however important this may be .
Mr President , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism had an in-depth discussion on the URBAN initiative which produced many ideas .
subsidiarity should make us realise that the state , exercising its governing functions , and local authorities are the bodies most able to intervene appropriately . the state can ensure public safety and the local authorities can help disadvantaged people .
Mr President , the INTERREG programme is particularly close to our hearts .
my region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais will be particularly affected with French Hainaut losing the aid paid to Objective 1 regions .
this would show respect for these peripheral areas which are rather concerned about enlargement to the east .
as far as we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are concerned , so far so good .
the Commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future .
a clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice , both for the party using the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer .
five amendments have been presented by Parliament .
a number of you made reference - Mr Nicholson in particular - to the issue surrounding labelling .
my question , Commissioner Byrne is this : the UN conference in Montreal decided that genetically-modified organisms must be labelled for international trade .
the disease is always fatal .
it is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it .
finally , I have certainly believed for a long time , coming from an agricultural background myself , that if we had fed the animals the proper food and if the animal feedstuffs had been made up of the proper compounds we would never have had BSE in the first place .
in the months I have been Commissioner and observed the way legislation goes through the system , I can see that much work needs to be done on this issue so that we can all achieve what we seek to achieve , that is , the translation of policy into legislation .
the majority of the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection meet these objectives . I hope they will be supported by this House .
that does not mean that we do not still have huge efforts to make in order to improve water protection yet further and maintain the quality of water and ground water and this will doubtless cost a great deal of money .
nevertheless , given that the idea of solidarity is central to the process of European construction , this directive must take into account the fact that water resources should be seen as a factor in social cohesion .
the topic has been brought under the codecision procedure and as a result , we have been able to draft important , more stringent legislation as early on as at first reading .
another important point of discussion is the standardisation of water quality .
in this connection , I would ask Parliament to support Amendment No 108 , in which the words `` water pollution caused by individual pollutants &apos;&apos; are replaced by `` prevention of water pollution through the continuous reduction in discharges &apos;&apos; .
we were recently rapped on the knuckles by the Commission regarding this matter .
as you know , there are problems which not only concern this House but also the European officials who are also European citizens .
with reference to the IGC , as you know , under the Helsinki decisions the Portuguese Presidency was given the specific entitlement to add to the agenda of the IGC during the course of the IGC .
this will therefore be our rule .
that concludes the debate .
but I repeat that the most important contribution we can make is to try to assist in the resolution of that conflict which has had such harmful economic and humanitarian results .
however , I can confirm that the principle of equal opportunity and equal treatment between men and women will certainly be included among the rights guaranteed by the future European Charter of Fundamental Rights . this is because this principle already figures among the rights guaranteed by the EC Treaty and by secondary legislation and because it undoubtedly constitutes a common constitutional tradition in the Member States .
thank you for the follow-up question . it is important for me to have a chance to answer it .
is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely , pending a review of the development plans of the area ?
the adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities , and does not require prior Commission approval .
there are only a few weeks to go before the elections .
we have criteria which are applied and we know roughly what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive .
I can only say that I must discuss these matters with the national authorities and government of each country . I am not avoiding the issue but I must abide by the general Regulation .
the opening of a building which was not finished , in the middle of an election campaign , which eight months after the opening can still not be occupied , makes the Spanish Government look ridiculous .
the Swedish Government and a large percentage of the Swedish people want the derogation to be extended on public health grounds .
European citizens have the right to buy goods for their own use , including taxes , in any Member Sate and to take them to another Member Sate without having to subject these goods to controls and without possibly having to pay another set of taxes on them .
the answer is that this is smuggled into the country or made by the Swedes themselves , and as Mr Andersson knows , this is an extremely dangerous and unhealthy activity .
he will also be aware of the effects the ban had on Mafia activity within the United States , where , eventually , prohibition was withdrawn .
the matter of excise taxes , to which the honourable Member is referring , is the prerogative of the Member State concerned .
it will no doubt engage in a discussion both with Parliament and the Council on this state of affairs , which indicates that there are quite a lot of differences in excise rates between Member States .
to this we must add the water pollution problems which afflict the potential new Member States in the East .
Mr President , first of all , we want to denounce the fathomless hypocrisy of those who claim to be concerned about the environment and water , but whose criminal activities such as the attacks against Yugoslavia , aside from leaving thousands dead and wounded , have also brought about huge ecological disasters for water resources too , making them not only unusable but even extremely hazardous .
in that spirit , we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos .
I should like to express my great appreciation of Mrs Lienemann &apos; s work on this matter .
these include , for example , costs and transfers .
despite the enlargement which has already taken place , when we renewed the first LIFE programme to move on to the second , despite enlargement , the level of appropriations remained the same .
fourthly , as Parliament ascribes so much value to LIFE , it has allocated ever-greater appropriations to this project in its annual budget . this means that approving the proposal put forward by the Council and by the Commission would represent an unacceptable reversal of this trend .
a drop in the ocean , I might say , in comparison with Europe &apos; s structural policies .
more than one third of the 8,500 requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to cofinance approximately 1,300 projects between 1992 and 1998 .
the Commission nonetheless considers that , if this is stated separately , then that is to go against the original decision to have the proposal focus on just a few priority areas .
I am convinced that you share my wish that it should be possible to adopt the regulation as soon as possible , especially in view of the fact that there are great expectations in the Member States and in other countries , especially among the applicant States which are now being given the opportunity to participate in LIFE .
I believe that congratulations are also in order for the Commission with regard to this notification , for these four points are , in fact , to a very large number of EU citizens extremely important - if not the most important points which merit further thought .
these are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them .
the European Union &apos; s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy .
without protection under intellectual property law , creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed .
-LRB- The sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m . -RRB-
the next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the coherence of EU policies with development .
as you know , an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies , and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency .
what we are talking about here today is not an issue which can be toyed with at leisure . poverty in the third world is a harrowing problem that demands urgent attention .
and yet we disregard local development agencies and prefer to negotiate with national governments and subsidise northern NGOs at the expense of local programmes and southern NGOs .
we could also add to the list the next EU-OAU summit which it has finally been agreed to hold in Cairo in April .
we have been waiting for a report on coherence for years .
I shall conclude with a few words about the Internet revolution .
let us use this not only for the benefit of our own populations but also for that of the developing countries .
this is not new .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the European Union played an active role in the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held in Geneva in March and April 1999 .
the European Union will oppose any spurious attempt to use this reform of the Human Rights Commission &apos; s activities to limit its capacity for intervention by restricting its sphere of influence and its ongoing monitoring of all human rights issues at world level .
naturally we should trade enthusiastically with China and hope that we can welcome China into the World Trade Organisation on sensible terms .
it will show whether the dialogue is producing results or not .
as far as the third phase of LIFE -LRB- 2000-2004 -RRB- is concerned , the instrument is to be divided into three sections , LIFE-Nature -LRB- 47 % of the resources -RRB- , LIFE-Environment -LRB- 47 % -RRB- and LIFE-Third Countries -LRB- 6 % -RRB- .
in institutional terms , there has been no clarification of what role the EP is to play in the further development of the WIPO Treaties .
it must be seen to deliver .
I also stressed the need for prevention .
the Commission did not do that .
it damages Parliament .
as regards the amendments concerning radioactive substances , I am of course in favour of controls , but the question arises of the legal basis , which comes under the Euratom Treaty .
it is also true , as it states in the explanatory statement , that harmonisation could be damaging as `` it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time as competitive considerations might exert pressure on more socially developed countries to cut back on social security .
otherwise it is merely the financial processing , at the expense and to the detriment of European citizens , of the intolerable social situations which result from immigration .
following the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission , I believe we can all agree that the current situation with regard to human rights is far removed from what we would all like to see .
with regard to foreign affairs , I believe that the majority of points which we have included in the resolution accurately illustrate the real situation and hardly invite optimism , Mr President . issues such as the abolition of the death penalty , the torture which still goes on in many supposedly democratic countries or the situation of minorities in many parts of the world , demand a clear , visible and effective response from the European Union .
the absence of the Council , as well as of the majority of MEPs , shows just how great the divide is between our noble , elevated and worthy formal statements and the concrete reality in terms of our day-to-day policies when it comes to human rights .
unless we can maintain high standards of human rights with respect to refugees and asylum-seekers , we are not worthy of those European values which make up the European identity , as Vaclav Havel said here today , and among which he particularly mentioned respect for human rights and solidarity .
this question does not challenge the efforts made by the Member States who wish to bring their viewpoints on foreign policy into line and to display a united front against violations of human rights elsewhere , for example in China .
this applies today to no fewer than thirty conflicts worldwide .
but unfortunately , as we speak today in the safety of this Chamber , human rights abuses are occurring throughout the free world .
in relation to China , we should not be dissuaded from raising the issue simply because discussions on it may be blocked .
to this end the High Commissioner recently launched an annual appeal for USD 53 million to enable her office to carry out these tasks .
my urgent request , which has been echoed many times in resolutions , is the following : could you not confer so that observers can be sent to the Moluccas ?
we can therefore safely say , for example , that the European Parliament has never allowed the situation in East Timor to be forgotten , which could have been the greatest obstacle to finding an equitable solution for its people , who always opposed occupation by Indonesia .
of course , words can make a bit of a difference , a point that was made by Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m .
there is also the question of our overall policy on human rights and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy .
the debate is closed .
I can not understand why the two small countries must be treated differently , nor why a clash was necessary between the institutional bodies . nor can I understand the pressure applied by Parliament to include the funds in Chapter 7 for the pre-accession strategy .
thirdly , we must not , in turn , allow the position taken by the Helsinki European Council to temper our efforts to resolve the Cypriot question before Cyprus joins the Union .
it is makeshift and contains heteronomous paragraphs , which is no way to set a shining example .
both the Commission and the Council have been making very optimistic speeches here today as well .
in conclusion , since I do not think I need to say much , given the unanimity that exists here , I just want to make one brief remark to the President-in-Office . I think that there are some peculiarities in his position .
nevertheless , I have said that I understand the arguments that people have been putting forward here and the Commission will endeavour to take account of these aspirations , but since this is all about Agenda 2000 and the Financial Perspective , we will not be able to do this without amending this Financial Perspective .
on the contrary , I would say that , although many areas of European policy leave something to be desired in terms of coherence , in this instance I would claim , on behalf of the Commission and the Council , that we have developed a very clear , transparent and coherent policy .
the debate is closed .
yet , the sum of EUR 378 million you mentioned had been given in 1999 , was proved by the facts to be quite insufficient to create even rudimentary civilised conditions in Kosovo , especially where the provision of health services is concerned .
does the Council consider that such accusations should be put before the War Crimes Tribunal for a thorough judicial investigation ?
if the Court of Auditors were able to assess regularly the potential conflicts between environmental concerns and structural development , it would be very important because the Court of Auditors could do an extremely good job .
but you never lost hope and history proved you right .
reconciliation with your neighbours was , and still is , a basic objective which you have defended with vigour and perseverance .
I want to see civil society given a louder voice .
Mr President , it can not be repeated often enough : since 1975 , the LomÃ© Convention has constituted an important pillar of European development cooperation and has a pilot role to play in many respects .
the ACP-EU Joint Assembly meets again in a few weeks time and I am sure this subject will be dealt with there .
paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution demand , within the context of the new agreement , that working methods should be developed and optimised .
the two large groups share all the reports and consultative documents etc between themselves .
in our view , it would be an illusion to think there was any point in FYROM applying for accession right now , but it would also be wrong to delay discussing it until some later date .
our agreement to the negotiations , as set out in the rapporteur &apos; s explanatory statement , is born of the conviction that it is right for Union policy to combine both a regional dimension and a more precise assessment of efforts made and results achieved by individual countries in moving towards the acquis communautaire .
we are now dealing with the stabilisation and association agreements , that is to say a medium-term issue .
this agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region .
but what then instead ?
Mr President , this is because I do not think that the harmonious day to day relations , contacts and communication between FYROM and Greece that have actually been achieved at both bipartite and multipartite level , and this mainly thanks to the practical arrangements of the intermediate agreement , I repeat , I do not think these sufficiently cover the conditions and criteria of good neighbourliness necessary , inter alia , for negotiating and concluding an association agreement .
in essence , FYROM is a miniature version of the former Yugoslavia , regardless of where one or another minority holds supremacy .
I want to stress , however , that whatever the programme is called , our commitment to the integration of FYROM and its neighbours into the European family is stronger than ever .
in particular , the decision outlines a form of parliamentary control whereby Parliament can sound the alarm if an implementing measure , deriving from an act adopted under the codecision procedure , oversteps the implementing powers delegated to the Commission .
Mr President , comitology is a concept most people do not know how to handle and hardly anyone knows what it means .
we expect the Commission to implement it . and then we have a system designed to hinder the Commission and make it more difficult - especially what was called the `` contre-filet &apos;&apos; system , under which the Council could block the Commission by a simple majority even when the Council was not capable of finding an alternative to the implementing measure concerned .
we need it because it lends our criteria the necessary seriousness and credibility .
it was a subject which called for a large dose of technical skill and I think Mr KnÃ¶rr has handled it with great precision and professionalism .
the manner in which the Council , which is by far the most undemocratic institution in Europe , consulted the European Parliament makes a mockery of the concept of democracy .
I also think we should perhaps consider setting up an interinstitutional or EU body in charge of coordinating the cooperation work .
that too is a concern of the people , for , as has rightly been said , this will be a new currency for them , new in terms of how it looks and also how it is used .
this really is a subject that is close to the citizen , so it is a pity it is being debated at such a late hour .
it is a question of weighing demands for liberalisation in the interests of a better market and higher yield against investors &apos; need for protection and security .
the capital markets are still at the mercy of their excesses .
by definition , investment funds use other people &apos; s money .
however , I will make sure that we have a go then and see how the land lies .
as far as the proposal for a new provision limiting investments in the same group to 15 % is concerned , I would like to stress that , apart from the fact that this limit is too low , the text does not define the concept of a group .
by allowing branches to be set up and certain services to be provided on a cross-border basis , these organisations will at long last be able to apply the freedoms of the Treaty of Rome , which they have been denied for all these years .
the Commission is in favour of codification and will , in the foreseeable future , once the proposals have been approved and subject to its right of initiative , concentrate its efforts on drafting a codified version .
however , the Commission will be suspending its position , given the intrinsically high risks of these investments compared to the more traditional financial instruments .
this would contravene the fact that EU legislation applies to all funds which invest in OTC instruments .
these are thus extremely important questions , which we hope that the Council will see fit to take up when formulating a new opinion .
by contrast , I welcome the attentive presence of Commissioner Vitorino , as has consistently been the case since his appointment . this leads me to another point .
Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanatory statement .
the text of Article 18 is ambiguous : he is restricting the activities of the intelligence services but seems to allow interception activities by a Member State in another Member State without the latter &apos; s prior authorisation .
in this way , Member States would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the State where interception occurs and the citizens within that State .
the Dutch Members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will , however , despite hesitation , not withhold their support for the Di Pietro report in the final vote .
I hope that before the end of this new LomÃ© Convention we will be able to welcome Cuba as a full member .
I know that this is somewhat controversial , particularly , because of the attitude of the United States Government towards the Castro regime .
after years of ` good and loyal service &apos; it is still the main symbol of efforts by the European Union to promote development and improve the lot of the poorest countries .
first , by promoting a trend towards regional meetings of the Joint Assembly , as recommended in the Corrie report , thereby enabling working methods to be adapted to the new types of cooperation envisaged -LRB- regional economic partnership agreements -RRB- .
firstly , decisions on corporate restructuring remain the prerogative as well as the responsibility of management .
yet again , workers are likely to lose their jobs .
perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here .
Mr President , Commissioner , whenever a serious social problem occurs , it always has a political basis .
we do not want Africa to become our cross , in fact quite the contrary .
firstly we are creating a network of reception centres for minors .
women and children were beaten .
it just remains for me to urge you all to attend the demonstration on Saturday .
a more vigorous integration policy should aim at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens &apos; .
B5-0166 @/@ 2000 by Mr QueirÃ³ , on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group , on Angola ;
B5-0171 @/@ 2000 by Mr Cossutta and Mr Vinci , on behalf of the GUE @/@ NGL Group , on the rights of the Dineh people , USA ;
first , because Mr Sakellariou , who is known for his openness and tolerance and whom I shall not quote , vehemently vetoed it in a bid to set himself up as your moral defender .
the silence of the major powers and our own silence are questionable and are benefiting a regime of corruption , violence and war .
these journalists are professionals who are trying to inform the public in their country and denounce the corruption existing in this regime , for which they are being persecuted .
Mr President , as Mr Van Hecke rightly pointed out , this is about human rights and about the rights of indigenous peoples , and Parliament must speak up , especially vis-Ã -vis good friends , and the United States is a good friend .
so we need to do this .
and just what is Mr CFSP doing ?
I am using the phrase ` is said to be &apos; on purpose , because official Chechen sources are still denying that they would have exchanged Mr Babitsky for a number of Russian prisoners of war .
in October , a member of parliament belonging to the same party was abducted by uniformed men and not released until the ransom was paid .
Mr President , there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law , according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes , and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights , not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected .
I am encouraged by the optimism of Kofi Annan , Secretary-General of the UN , on the chances of agreement on the proposed tribunal .
the delta of the Danube is in danger .
here , then , I want to point out that international competition is tough and , if we are to overcome it positively , we must together envision and share a long-term strategy .
second , there are similar issues related to the establishment of a multiannual programme for tourism .
having heard many Members who share the view expressed in the opinion , this was a real relief .
in addition , employment policy in general is also a factor .
it will not do for one type of policy , probably with many exceptions and adaptations , to be applied .
clearly it is impossible to adopt measures at the national level .
the Minutes of yesterday &apos; s sitting have been distributed .
it is alleged in a circular that the price of postage has gone up by 59 per cent since liberalisation in 1993 .
for example it has enabled us to fly from peripheral parts of the European Union to the centre for a fraction of the cost of 20 years ago .
as is known , the Commission should already , before the end of 1998 , have tabled new proposals for a revision of the Postal Services Directive 97 @/@ 67 , guaranteeing the continued provision of a universal service , securing its economic viability , and regulating the gradual liberalisation of the postal services market while taking into account the consequences of this for all those involved , including postal workers and customers .
Mr President , postal services and post offices seem to be very topical in Parliament at the moment and rightly so , given their importance .
the end result will be that existing companies will also be forced into bad practices .
I believe we should give the postal service a chance to adapt to new trends .
Scotland also has many island communities , some of which can be reached by air but most of which depend on sea ferries .
that concept I reject firmly , because competition is there for the citizens , and for them alone .
adjournment of the session
what difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function ? &apos;&apos;
ETA must be condemned . however , those who support and express understanding for these attacks must also be condemned .
we share with all the Basque citizens the sufferings of our people .
these are the areas in which changes will be made .
I know that my colleagues and I can count on the support of many Members of this House across the spectrum .
in each of the three pillars of reform , the active support and cooperation of this House will be absolutely vital .
it is clear , of course , that in many ways the really hard work starts now , with the implementation of our proposals .
Madam President , the Commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials .
it has to give a service to them and certainly the recommendations on cutting down on payment delays I am sure will be very welcome , but the other major complaint we get from the people we represent is paperwork .
the proposed timetable is tight but essential and will require great determination from all of us , including this House .
-LRB- The Commissioner indicated that he would speak later -RRB- Very well , thank you .
as George Robertson has said so often , we have two million soldiers but could not even put 40 000 soldiers into Kosovo .
Minister Geremek is certainly not the only leader among the new NATO Members from central and eastern Europe who feels excluded from this crucial process today .
the Czech Defence Minister , for example , shares this opinion . in the autumn of last year , the latter stated : `` Security within Europe is not divisible .
Mr President , Bosnia and Kosovo have shaken Europe .
on the other hand , despite his declarations on humanity and peace , it is clear from what Mr Solana has told us that , according to the Helsinki resolutions , we intend to set up a terrorist army , starting with 60 000 men , in order to strike at anyone who raises their head above the parapet .
secondly , the Baltic States are also knocking on our door .
could you give us an initial reaction to this initiative , without compromising the more detailed reaction which you may be able to give us in the Foreign Affairs Committee ?
how else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants , the unremitting and inordinate bombing of towns , villages and districts where , in amongst the whole of the civilian population , there are perhaps a handful of Chechen fighters ?
I strongly support the decisions taken at Sintra . they constitute a significant step towards establishing an effective European Security and Defence Policy .
Mr President , High Representative , Commissioner , I have two questions for you , Mr Solana .
I think there is an umbilical cord between neglecting human rights , between neglecting habeas corpus , between neglecting all the usual rules of good governance , between tyranny and between environmental degradation .
so , there should be no positive discrimination to include women .
when I see that we are asking for training for women in politics , I want to say - no , definitely not .
a third decision will be considered in the light of the mission of Commissioner Nielson .
the time has also come to demand greater efficiency .
otherwise , apart from the tragedy created by the floods , the next tragedy will arise : that of a lack of aid to the people , who will die of hunger and disease and who will die in the floods .
one is to adopt the Commission &apos; s own excellent , outstanding econometric analysis , and ask the Council to transform it into a programme of action involving certain interconnected quantifiable targets of levels of investment growth and employment that would make our commitment to a policy of full employment operational and credible .
the report which has come to you from the Economic Committee sins in all these respects .
I think that in adopting this wide socio-economic approach , the European Union is taking exactly the right line , not least because that is the economic entity on the basis of which policy is drafted .
yesterday , as some of you have noted , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs referred to the improvement in the economic situation in Europe .
and what should we make of the data on fleet capacity ?
the intention in adopting the current regime was to eradicate ISA and to do so as quickly as possible .
this approach has been used very effectively in Norway where new reports of ISA are down to a handful of cases a year having peaked at some 80-90 cases per year in the early 1990s .
you may know that with effect from 15 January 2000 , under the new financial instrument for fisheries guidance , Member States may encourage eradication of diseases in aquaculture .
I believe that measures that are proportionate to that objective is the way forward .
bluefin tuna is the world &apos; s most expensive fish fetching up to EUR 90 000 per ton at the auctions in Tokyo and , of course , the indication of the importance of the Mediterranean tuna is that it accounts for 70 percent of global landings in the region of 30 000 tons .
given this context , I would like to tell you about something that happened a few days ago .
conservation is something that I hear on many occasions and a lot of people pay lip service to it .
we hope to hear specific proposals from the Commission , with plenty of action and no more regrets .
we must urgently amend our legislation and close the loopholes which keep allowing these terrible disasters to happen .
the French State has released funds for compensating damage .
it was furthermore widely known , as you have just said , Mrs Morgantini , that Israel &apos; s interpretation of the territory to which the agreement applies does not match our own .
Mr President , Commissioner , it is true that the present trade agreement between Israel and the EC is ambiguous .
it would not be fair and evenhanded to rush into a decision without letting the talks and the groups that it is meeting determine what the situation is , both in terms of the area of the State of Israel relating to the trade agreement and , as I say , in relation to the goods and where they come from at the same time .
the debate is closed .
- -LRB- FR -RRB- The amendment to the directive as presented by the Commission is an important one since it deals with a specific disease , i.e. infectious salmon anaemia , a contagious viral disease .
- -LRB- SV -RRB- We have chosen to abstain in the vote on Amendment 4 to the Katiforis report on the EU Economy -LRB- 1999 -RRB- .
I would cordially request that you look into this matter with the Strasbourg authorities and investigate whether criminal activity is at work here , and whether it is linked to trafficking in women and forced prostitution .
it is well within our reach because we have a solid macroeconomic basis , to which we must now add the Lisbon Summit , in terms of human resources and new ideas regarding the market and the harnessing of technical skills and research .
we have to consider in particular the future creation and maintenance of resources in promising sectors in terms of employment . these are obviously information technology , electronic commerce , tourism , and , for example , services for the elderly , as our populations are undeniably ageing all the time .
the Commission refers , appropriately in my opinion , to deficits that hinder the growth of employment in the Union .
where we do , too little of it is converted into market product and services .
we have heard nothing about the universal telecommunications service being redefined in order to make it possible for everyone to access the Internet under the best possible technical conditions and at affordable rates .
it is possible if we attack the real causes , which we feel are inseparable from the drift towards neo-liberalism , which has been shaping underlying trends , specifically in the macroeconomic field .
today , they are no longer so much being promoted in line with much vaunted conservative principles , as on the grounds of so-called globalising pragmatism and in the name of competitiveness , which has been elevated to godlike status .
when I see that many companies engaged in e-commerce admittedly have huge market capitalisation , but that their actual business is constantly making losses , this does not necessarily make me feel any more optimistic .
has a decision been made in favour of selective growth in such policy ?
if the Lisbon Summit is serious about fighting unemployment , then we will need more than generic measures .
education is to be put in order , a fiscal policy devised and venture capital arranged .
we live in the time of IDEA - the Internet digital electronic age .
because , as you have already stressed , we do not need one more process after another , one procedure after another ; rather we need action by which the people of the European Union can measure the benefits and added value of what the European Union does .
in Lisbon you will clearly be trying to lift the world or , in any case , our world , the world of Europe .
Mr President , along with my colleagues , I would like to welcome the very clear document that the Portuguese Presidency has given us today .
European citizens must believe in this project and this state of affairs . they must not see it as something abstract which we only speak about in Brussels or Strasbourg .
we therefore have to re-establish conditions of full employment , employment adapted to the society which is taking shape , which we are all building .
remember the European company : we have not yet reached unanimity over the European company , but hundreds of thousands of companies are demanding it .
the Rio Conference involved preparing an action programme which , on a sector-by-sector basis , points out the most important problem areas in this context and states how protection of the environment and of natural resources is to be ensured .
in the industrialised countries , significant initiatives are being taken to preserve and protect the environment .
however we are aware that if unlimited duration were to be approved here , this would lead inevitably to a conciliation process .
please forgive me . my files have got in rather a muddle .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
otherwise we will fall back into a variety of systems and it will be years - in a manner of speaking - before we learn from the lesson we have actually already been taught .
there is a whole raft of other factors involved and we have reached agreement on a great many of them .
this would give us the opportunity to reach an agreement with the Council in the conciliation procedure , whether it be on 75 % or whatever .
how do we charge the fees ?
I hope that we will not jeopardise the entire directive on account of a too principled stance on one point .
it should be emphasised , in this context , that it is not mainly legislation that is missing .
in this respect , I believe that the legislation intended by this directive covers various aspects relating to the delivery of waste to ports .
and this is where the problem lies .
it is precisely in those countries that employment permits and work contracts are not checked up on .
the motion proposes the introduction of spot checks , as vehicles have to be deemed roadworthy between tests too .
I should prefer for this vote to be held tomorrow .
the next item is the continuation of the debate on the European Commission &apos; s annual legislative programme for the year 2000 .
President Prodi , allow me to express my apprehension and alarm at the line taken in the Work Programme for 2000 , a year which you described as a decisive year , and not only because of the lack of genuinely innovative proposals contained therein .
I therefore stress that , if we want to have the Commission and Parliament working together , we have to be able to come up with a solution to this problem as soon as possible and not to have limitations on documents which are available to citizens .
we consider that , with the implementation of the geo-political processes , the Mediterranean border is just important as eastward enlargement , which both Parliament and the Commission are working on .
it is essential .
Seattle failed because the United States , in particular , appeared unable to grasp the legitimacy of policies such as environmental protection , the preservation of rural communities through the common agricultural policy , animal welfare , health concerns and social rights .
one thing I would like to say very strongly is that we are very concerned in follow-up , not simply in excellent communications , which we welcome , but in follow-up , follow-up , follow-up ! ! ! !
I will now use a tremendous clichÃ© truism - ` our greatest resource in the European Union is our people &apos; .
now that we are establishing new measures , how do we know they will be used ?
furthermore , we also have to accept that officials who take responsibility and risks may make mistakes .
without that sort of protection people will not take the opportunity to live , move and work wherever they can within the European Union .
we can not do other than give this programme our full backing .
we must make the most of this opportunity , since , as you have pointed out , we have a major problem with our budget .
in February , we presented an annual report on the actions carried out in 1999 , which we would like to expand .
I would like to finish off with the following thought .
those who deny that and say that we are still in the position of total obstruction , are really admitting - as those are who wish in the vote tomorrow to reject the common position - that they do not want this directive at all .
you can have additional labelling if you want .
what right , then , has the European Union , with regard to the food traditions of some Member States who incorrectly describe products including vegetable fats other than cocoa butter as ` chocolate &apos; , to enforce a change in the very definition of what chocolate is ?
surely scheduling an economic impact study years after the application of a directive belongs to the realm of the absurd ?
furthermore , inspection depends on the type of chocolate and the information which the producer wishes to provide .
however , since that is no longer possible , I think that the common position is acceptable .
as for the developing countries , I want to say that , if Britons , Scandinavians and others are not allowed to eat the chocolate they ate as children , they would certainly eat marshmallows or jelly babies instead on a Saturday evening .
we would benefit from additional discussions among party groups on certain details in relation to some of the amendments .
this responsibility is a historical one , primarily , and is related to the commitments made by Member States to the countries where the bulk of the tropical forest is located .
there are , however , two points that I would like to mention here .
moreover , at a time when certain communication systems , certain spying systems , are prohibited , we must guarantee citizens &apos; rights with regard to the new European bodies which are being developed , and guarantee the rights of the citizen by means of parliamentary monitoring , but also consumer rights with regard to the new Internet marketing techniques .
obviously , as far as those who promote the charter are concerned , defending fundamental rights which are already adequately protected in Europe at present , whatever they may say , is nothing but a pretext to conceal another , purely ideological , objective , which is to establish the beginnings of a European constitution , the crowning achievement of a superstate , even though the majority of the peoples of Europe do not want either of these .
next , the charter would provide a new pretext for the frenzied standardisation of citizens &apos; rights in Europe .
in particular , certain rules of some of the penal codes should be altered , such as article 141 of the Italian Penal Code , which goes so far as to punish acts of secession with life imprisonment .
a meeting was proposed for the purpose of producing a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European citizen .
manifestly we do exist and therefore manifestly we already have some kind of a constitution .
it is a pretext , when the very title of the proposed charter speaks of the fundamental rights ` of &apos; the European Union instead of fundamental rights ` within &apos; the European Union .
why not a simple declaration of human rights under Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty without the need for a charter for litigation ?
many citizens do not know the rights that exist today .
what is clear , and what unites most people in this Chamber who want such a Charter , is that it must be in the Treaties .
I hope that this position will be retained in tomorrow &apos; s sitting , as it will be vitally important if we wish to avoid confusion with the many various schemes in respect of fundamental rights .
in my view , there has not to date been so much discussion on the subject .
the Europe to which we belong is even , to a certain extent , the cradle of the culture of fundamental rights .
the appropriate setting in which to enshrine fundamental rights is the constitutional law of each nation state .
furthermore , I recommend that you carefully read the contribution of the observer representing the European Court of Human Rights in the Convention responsible for drafting the Union &apos; s Charter of Fundamental Rights .
ladies and gentlemen , I should first like to remind you that the proposals which you are to receive in a few moments , or in a few hours , do not include any transfer of jurisdiction , nor do they constitute an action programme in essence .
the second point I would like to make is that the Commission does not wish to impose the levelling of national tax systems or social security systems .
my question is this : will the Commission &apos; s work programme include a schedule for this , or how do you intend to proceed ?
that also goes , of course , for his special representative .
how much money goes into mine action programmes and how much into R &amp; D in de-mining technology ?
the resources available for EU mine actions should remain at least at the same level in real terms as we have achieved over the last few years , that is about EUR 30 million a year .
subject : ` Dialogue on Europe &apos; initiative The President of the Commission intends to launch this initiative on 8 March 2000 .
my own view is that the accession of China to the WTO , whilst perhaps not quite as eye-catching as a multilateral agreement , is just as important to the future global trade regime , and that a similarly political position might therefore be taken by both Parliament and the Commission .
subject : cost to agriculture of EU enlargement On the basis of the most recent studies and estimates , what cost will the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union place on agriculture and what will be the impact thereof ?
the Commissioner has not been explicit .
you raised the idea of studies : the first studies were made several years back , and we sent these to Parliament .
there is little point in doing that in our view .
at present , the limits vary widely within Europe , from 0.8 in some countries down to 0.2 in Sweden .
alcohol is also the greatest contributory cause of accidents on European roads and a very important contributory cause of the most serious accidents .
I would point out that the alternative project ATT3 - and I would like to thank Commissioner Kinnock and the chairman , Mr Coleman , for their efforts here - has been examined closely and in great detail by the Commission over the past two years , and I have also received a written report on this .
this is all about people living in a sensitive area who must be protected .
what are the weaknesses in the current eco-label regulation which have given rise to today &apos; s unsatisfactory situation ?
the moral of this story is , of course , that to compete in the mainstream market , eco-products must give a performance close to their alternatives .
this applies , for example , to Amendments 7 and 8 . these are only available in English , which is totally unacceptable .
such a thing does not yet currently exist .
I believe that we are , in this way , obtaining a good tool for preventing and limiting environmental damage in connection with waste incineration and for preventing and limiting the associated risks to human health .
I think that defensible levels have been identified in this connection , and a reasonable balance has been struck between incineration plants proper and the combined plants .
again in contrast to Mrs GrossetÃªte , I want , moreover , to say that the levels set here for emissions are realistic .
so we have to ensure that there is frequent testing and monitoring , that regular and detailed information is made available to the public , and that real action is taken against breaches of the rules .
we should treat this seriously .
we can not say that it is all wrong .
my question to the Commissioner , which I hope that she will able to answer when she comes , is this : since we have not moved an exception to take account of these on-farm incinerators , is this the first time the European Commission has heard of this difficulty ?
this year we are talking about close to 60 million tonnes , and waste incineration generates , as everyone has mentioned , the emission of particularly dangerous substances into the atmosphere and soil .
together with the Council &apos; s determination to arrive quickly at a common position , the report has helped with the efficient reading of the Commission &apos; s proposal .
this is also justified from the point of view of cost-income analysis .
as things stand all other animal waste is covered by Article 2 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- -LRB- v -RRB- of the directive and Directive 90 @/@ 667 .
I would also like to thank the European Commission for its sound green proposals .
on the initiative of the Green Group , the European Parliament then adopted a resolution to halve the ozone standard stipulated in the 1992 directive .
at the same time , research shows that the reasons why ozone affects cities such as Barcelona , Athens and Milan and many of the tourist resorts along the coast must be sought elsewhere .
finally , we must reject the first and third sections of Amendment No 5 , together with Amendments Nos 17 and 18 . in the present situation , we quite simply do not have enough information available to be able to predict when the long-term objective of not exceeding the World Health Organisation &apos; s guidelines can be attained .
the Commission &apos; s proposal sets limit values for each Member State with regard to certain kinds of interrelated emissions , which cause acidification , increased ozone in the inner atmosphere and soil eutrophication .
Mr President , the industry committee , after much discussion and serious consideration , is overwhelmingly opposed to the Commission &apos;s proposed ceilings , and this is across all groups and nationalities .
this model is sound and the results are well founded .
yes , we could go there - we should be trying to go there , but I do not think we should be starting there .
we are , for the most part , complying with the emission targets proposed in the now current directive .
the Commission has a great deal of sympathy with the concerns underlying Amendments Nos 16 and 17 .
now Mr Schnellhardt has even suggested that perhaps we made a mistake with the fauna-flora-habitats directive .
I am not suggesting that we contravene legislation .
Commissioner Barnier probably said to you today , Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m , that all European programmes should be able to start without undue delay because it can be extremely difficult to make up for lost time later on .
that is what the EU has signed up to in countless treaties from the Rio Earth Summit onwards .
50th anniversary of the Geneva Convention - humanitarian law
I congratulate the President for domestic reasons . I would now like to speak , on behalf of the Socialist Group , in this debate which follows what we consider to be a satisfactory statement from the Council on the Geneva Convention .
so there is a solution to all these humanitarian issues which are referred to the Geneva Convention , and this solution is co-determined by us on a daily basis within our European Parliament , where 15 nationalities cooperate in a peaceful manner .
they must be built upon and the establishment of the International Criminal Court was a significant development in the field of human rights .
do we really want race discrimination protection throughout the European Union ?
other practices , such as polygamy or the inheriting of widows , have become untenable in an AIDS era .
it is not so much a question of what is said , and the more talk there is of human rights , the worse are the abuses .
are the rights guaranteed under the Convention on Human Rights better than those guaranteed under the EU &apos; s Charter ?
when we hold a debate on Austria , when we draw up a document on the Austrian situation - if Parliament judges it appropriate so to do - then we might even be able to give Baroness Ludford the task of drawing up a document which we will debate together .
these remarks have no place in a document on human rights , as they should not be using up the time allocated to the Baroness &apos; s report , and so they have acquired the bitter taste of political exploitation of a very serious issue such as human rights .
point 38 , which was amended for the worse by Amendment No 22 , cited again today in the Chamber , imposes on Italy - and who knows why Italy should be singled out - in order to guarantee the impartiality of judges , not the separation of judicial and political authorities , as advocated by Montesquieu , but the separation , within the judiciary , of the careers of judges responsible for giving rulings and investigating magistrates .
it is only logical that we should observe these values .
I have subscribed to this practice in the Netherlands for some 25 years , starting with the South Moluccans .
we need consistency , patience and a well thought-out strategy for turning noble words into concrete action that leads to results .
we have no hesitation in reiterating that there is no room in my country for the descendants of the former kings of Italy .
you are forgetting that families obtain their rights from the State and from the nations clearly because they allow the State and the nations to continue in existence and because they have a common interest .
there is much talk of a Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I agree with this criticism , despite the fact that , as chairman of the Delegation for relations with the People &apos;s Republic of China , I risk receiving yet another protest letter from Beijing asking whether the European Parliament is waging a hostile campaign against China .
we should therefore voice to the Estonians and Latvians our express recognition of the fact that they have managed to keep a cool head and that they are receptive to our arguments when it comes to adapting their legislation in this area to European standards .
at the same time , the mass media need to help fight prejudices and to demonstrate the beauty of modern multicoloured , multicultural society .
they do not want to see mere hot air from politicians , which just adds to global warming .
there is a growing concern about the environmental consequences of landfill sites in general .
the day of landfill sites is now coming to an end and they must be replaced by more environmentally beneficial technologies .
we are today debating a legislative proposal which affects us all directly as it aims to improve ambient air quality .
the report also asks the Commission to propose new amendments to the directive by 2004 .
Portugal holds the presidency of the European Union for the first half of the year 2000 . it has therefore decided to organise at the end of this month , in Lisbon , a Special European Council on the following problem : ` Employment , Economic Reforms and Social Cohesion - towards a Europe based on innovation and knowledge &apos; .
prosperity is the preserve of big business , before which all bow down in reverence , making it more and more immune , throwing the job market even more out of kilter in the name of increased productivity and competitiveness , attacking social and other rights which have been won even more violently and promoting the perception that the modern -LRB- antiÂ­ -RRB- social state need only throw the people a few crumbs of charity .
you will find them fighting for a social , democratic , mutually supportive Europe , a workers &apos; Europe , a Europe of the people , and you will find us by their side , fighting with them .
we must declare that everyone is entitled to their physical and mental integrity and that this integrity involves the right to a decent life .
has the author ever tried to enter public office in Morocco for example ?
no one is being deprived of the right to work and no one is being deprived of the right to belong to a trade union , but individuals can not benefit from extensive social agreements without also being themselves members of precisely that union which has produced the agreements .
Parliament would like to gain more insight into , and an overview of , all the actions and intentions on the part of the European Union and the Commission and would therefore ask the Commission to produce a coherent programme , based on strengthened cooperation , with objectives and timeframes .
at the same time , local cooperation is an effective tool against prejudice and discrimination .
the first which I should like to mention are the Roma and Sinti ; they represent a very large section of the population and we must seriously consider how they can be sensibly integrated into society .
I now turn to the issues raised in the Belder report which responds to the Commission &apos; s communication on countering racism , xenophobia and antisemitism in the candidate countries .
the bilateral sanctions are therefore exactly that . they are not sanctions within the operational framework of the Community .
you therefore had no right to speak on behalf of their countries ; on the contrary , you obviously spoke as the head of a socialist party .
Mrs Flemming , the debate on Austria should not be restarted as we have already had an exchange of views on this issue .
I will give the floor to Mr Schulz who wanted to raise a point of order on a personal challenge made in yesterday &apos; s debate .
Madam President , I seldom make use of these rules but I must do so now for the record .
and believe me , we shall do so .
this is a legally uncertain basis for legislation and that makes me unhappy .
should it not be asking why Spain can afford to send so many vets over to the United Kingdom to implement a related directive and perhaps be insisting that some of these officials be retained in their homeland to implement Community law in their own country ?
the new provision concerning the implementing powers for the Commission to lay down transitional measures may have a direct effect on public health .
I note from the document that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has circulated this afternoon where he signals his intention to put forward this amendment at this stage .
therefore the concerns that you have in relation to this matter will be remedied automatically in accordance with that agreement .
it makes no sense to continue with the debate .
these are issues that the Romanian authorities say they are taking very seriously and , as far as I could ascertain , they consider that they stem from a cultural situation affecting certain sections of the population .
I detected a great commitment by the Romanian authorities to going as far as possible to confront situations of this kind .
Mr President-in-Office , I think that you have clarified the technical aspects of Articles 6 and 7 very fully indeed .
in what way do the European Council and the European institutions lose power and the potential to formulate policy as a result ?
question No 8 by -LRB- H-0166 @/@ 00 -RRB- :
after each meeting of the Council , a press release is issued which contains information on decisions taken by the Council .
unless I am very much mistaken , Mr Nicholson , the majority of governments do not broadcast meetings at which they are acting in their legislative capacity .
the advantage to Mexico is obvious .
we know from the WTO that environmental laws are regularly sidelined as the result of such disputes .
at the same time , the Saint AndrÃ©s agreements and the rights of the indigenous peasants are not being observed .
we ought to put this into some sort of context , though , and remind ourselves that the majority of people in the world have never made and probably never will make even one phone call .
secondly : we must quickly create a legal framework for electronic commerce .
industrialisation , atomic energy and biotechnology have not brought freedom and prosperity for all .
a universal service points the right way , but the idea should not be implemented by providers which censor the Internet by using technical devices to deny their customers access to parts of the Net .
a high level of protection is essential for the effective spread of the use of new technologies to the daily lives of millions of people , and clear rules will have to be defined if European citizens are to be able to take full advantage of the benefits .
technology and industry are better equipped to respond to consumer concerns in what is an immensely competitive market .
that is a task for the Council , Parliament and the Commission .
how can we become more competitive ?
the `` e-Europe &apos;&apos; communication focuses on the actions necessary to accelerate the transition to the information society .
we have made a quick check here and the Portuguese text seems to have the same meaning as the French text , implying that the majority of this House believes fundamental rights can be violated if the European Parliament agrees to it .
I ask for it to be recorded in the Minutes that I did not take part in the vote .
secondly , I should like to say that there is a rule here , that it is standard practice to vote up to 1.30 p.m. on Thursdays and to leave the rest until 6.00 p.m. , after the urgent votes .
allow me to recapitulate : the President said that we are to vote at 5.30 this evening on whether or not to postpone the vote until the next plenary session .
so we must provide for direct resort to that Court in accordance with certain procedures .
we are therefore abstaining from voting in the final vote .
there is a gap to be filled in providing fundamental rights to citizens of the Member States concerning European regulation and legislation .
and what about that manifestation of respect for human rights that took the form , for several weeks , of bombing Kosovo and Serbia ?
firstly , I do not support the right of gay couples to adopt .
nonetheless , we can not see how this additional document can contribute to the fight for human rights , except by injecting a little more legal confusion .
our citizens want a peaceful solution to the conflict in Western Sahara and they want the Sahrawi people to hold the referendum under conditions of freedom , transparency and equality .
that is why we call on the Commission and the Council to act before it is too late .

situation in Iraq
we have not yet reached that point , but we did hear how Russian society is currently becoming more radical from an expert this morning .
he was due to visit the European Parliament today and give us an eye witness account of the situation in Chechnya , but he was not allowed to leave Russia .
it is a scandal and we can not accept it .
given this sad situation , all those in Serbia who stand up for the freedom of the press deserve our support .
we discussed this issue when we met with members of the US Congress in our normal framework of delegations earlier this year .
the European Commission &apos;s Europe-by-satellite service is continuing its support by making available time on its service for independent TV stations in Serbia to broadcast information which will reach the rest of the region and encourage exchange of programmes .
the international community &apos;s concern for the region is a legitimate one , particularly as both sides possess nuclear weapons and as dialogue between them has , at this stage , effectively broken down .
B5-0274 @/@ 2000 by Mrs Frassoni and others , on behalf of the Group of the Greens @/@ European Free Alliance , on the urgent situation created by crime linked to illegal trafficking in Apulia -LRB- Italy -RRB- ;
let me give you just one example of this : paragraph 22 , which seeks to give substance to European citizenship , by granting rights to vote in European and local elections to third country nationals resident in the Community .
the British Labour members and the PSE Group voted in favour of Amendment 2 to delete paragraph 17 , not because we opposed the sentiments and intentions , but as it was open to possible misinterpretation or charges of ambiguity .
the differences are being ironed out at every level , for the Haarder report also supports equal rights for same-sex couples and the traditional family .
it is also positive that the report should recommend that citizens of third countries should have better opportunities for integration .
it is against that background that this year , as ever , we are once again debating human rights in the world and in the Union , accompanied this time by a debate on countering racism in the European Union and the candidate states .
I know that in making these points I risk being demonised by the media and falling into the trap some sections of the report are setting for those among us who still dare express their opinion in the face of the exaggerations on which Baroness Ludford &apos; s report bases what it sees as a rise in racism and xenophobia .
sadly , Mrs Zana &apos; s case is no exception !
nevertheless , a central bank that depended on being bailed out repeatedly would not be very credible .
in the event of another international financial crisis , which remains possible given the irrational exuberance of the markets , there could be a need for concerted intervention by the main central banks .
the reasons are set out in detail and time is already marching on , but allow me to say that we consider that this increase is needed .
firstly : does it make political and economic sense to apply the sort of restrictive monetary policy which the ECB applies and which is more restrictive than the FED ?
it is rather shattering to read in the report that , should the political authorities - Parliament and the Council - refuse to help to bring about a structural improvement in the financial position of the ECB , the latter would no longer be regarded as independent by the markets .
people have rights and I do not think that the comment that was made yesterday was acceptable .
on examination of our amendments , it is clear that they have a human aspect and allow a far more dynamic , open discussion .
I therefore welcome the rapporteur &apos; s proposal that the Commission should match the budgetary appropriations to the numerous organisations that have a right to funding under this regulation .
grain legumes
I agree with the statement made by Commissioner Barnier in a written reply to me when he said that the spirit of additionality rather than the letter of the law on the matter is an important consideration .
now these stories are not just topical background to this debate .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to reiterate the words of Mr Miller , who spoke earlier - and who is regrettably no longer in the Chamber - when he criticised the authors of this question by saying that our main task is to ensure that the rules are complied with .
in my personal experience in Ireland , I never heard the European Commission take Ireland to task for failure in the area of additionality .
it reduced in real terms by 30 % .
if , for example , an airline providing regional services was privatised , regional disinvestment could occur , and we would thus be infringing the principle of additionality .
no additional money has been built into the budget of our Welsh Assembly .
because of the Labour Government &apos;s tardiness in submitting its proposed maps nine months late in December instead of March last year , it is still struggling to come up with acceptable specific projects .
ladies and gentlemen , I should like to get on with the items on the agenda .
we do still have two of them , though .
it seems that there is also a list of Greek subjects and I see that Turkey &apos; s Foreign Minister has stated that any country can make such lists .
Madam President , there were two issues within my area of competence dealt with in the Commission this morning and I have the pleasure and the honour to report to Parliament on both of these issues .
you will be aware that our plans , which are set out in the White Paper on food safety , contain a provision relating to the introduction of legislation in respect of a general food law , and there are many other legal provisions contained in the White Paper which are designed to protect food safety , and by inference consumers .
I have announced on several occasions that I consider the new rapid post-mortem tests to be one of the most important tools in our efforts to control BSE .
so the best possible date that I can predict for all this to happen and the best estimate that I can give for a commencement date having regard to all these factors is January 2001 .
so if they want us to help them , they must first help us , they must first contribute towards progress by showing goodwill .
I am not going to expand on what the stages have been , since you are perfectly familiar with them .
I think that we should begin with a legislative procedure at the end of the year .
but having said that , it is important to get each trade dispute in proportion .
I understand that we must not be inflexible . we must offer an opportunity for dialogue and understanding , but in order for this to happen , the United States must agree to adopt certain approaches .
and this is a weak point .
in fact , this love-hate situation between certain Community regions and the Maghreb creates unnecessary tensions , both economic and social , which we must resolve by putting all our powers of negotiation on the table and by using all the existing mechanisms , or new ones which should be created , in order to relaunch Euro-Mediterranean cooperation .
investments in these areas are primarily supported by loans from the European Investment Bank as well as other donors .
it would certainly be cause for satisfaction , and would be a significant step in the right direction , if this debate were to persuade the Commission to promote a more active attitude to the relaunch of the Euro-Mediterranean association agreement .
I have allowed you the extra minute since you are chairman of the Maghreb delegation .
I believe , however , that it is not enough to make declarations of pious intent about human rights and the rule of law and then forget all about them , the way many things are forgotten . no , this policy must be made a key element in bilateral relations .
the European Union and twelve Mediterranean countries were consequently pleased to adopt the famous Barcelona Declaration in 1995 .
my feeling , on the occasion of this debate , is that it is worth paying tribute to the actions of this great man of peace , this indefatigable pilgrim .
the problem can not be resolved solely by means of readmission and border control agreements , although they are necessary . in terms of the action plans , these measures seem to be given priority over the ones I have just mentioned
I also consider it necessary to create an immigration monitoring centre because , in addition to coordinating statistical data , this would allow sociological studies to be carried out on the phenomenon of migration , which would help in the decision-making process .
with regard to respect for human rights , there must be greater cooperation in order to modernise the administrative structures of some of the selected countries . we must also cooperate in the training of police forces and , in particular , open them up to cooperation with the NGOs , which have a social role to play in this area .
finally , Mr President , I hope that , with regard to these plans and the plans to come , the defects highlighted in this resolution will be corrected and that there will be closer cooperation , especially on the part of the High Level Working Group and the Council , with Parliament . I also hope , of course , that the Commission will be given the resources to carry them out .
on the contrary , the alternative to action at EU level is a negotiation of bilateral and multilateral accords among independent nations .
the action plans , however , can be considered as a first step in creating an external policy on migration of the European Union and should therefore be given a chance .
the important role Member States have to play was , by the way , acknowledged at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of last Monday , 27 March .
the Committee highlights the need for adequate appropriations to be provided and for the relevant comments to be added to the budget with regard to the strict application of the principle of mainstreaming which guarantees equal opportunities between men and women in the planning , implementation and assessment of all European Union projects and programmes .
with regard to Mr Ferber &apos; s report , we would like to remark that we are disinclined to take a position on the details as yet , including the establishment of posts .
naturally , we must finance the Kosovo mission as a fundamental political objective , in order to erase the effects of the war and to prove the existence of a political objective , but we can not always do so at the expense of agriculture .
indeed , we would protest against the veritable misappropriation of funds which is proposed : the inappropriate use of resources reserved for agricultural expenditure under Category I of the financial perspective as a source of funding to be used to meet funding requirements in the sphere of foreign policy .
without a constant and intense effort in these fields there will be no competitiveness and a lack of competitiveness means no new jobs will be created .
Mr President , it takes some nerve to state that employment is , and I quote , a constant priority of the European institutions at a time when the European Union has 18 million unemployed and when , at this very moment , a number of the most wealthy of all major European businesses are announcing savage job cuts without the said institutions lifting a finger to prevent them .
it has been pointed out on several sides that demands are being made on the Commission .
I think we are all in agreement on the fact that , in comparison with the last decade , we must focus more strongly on financial assistance and financial aid for the regions .
the Council and Commission have indeed supported the principle of extraterritorial jurisdiction , but these drafts still allow for the criterion of dual criminality in exceptional cases .
I therefore support Amendment No 4 calling for a European centre for missing children and victims of sexual abuse to be set up in order to coordinate the activities of the organisations set up in the Member States .
at the same time , further progress in this direction will contribute to our response to the concerns expressed by European citizens at the development of this scourge .
we need more and deeper study for that purpose .
do we want to mimic the Americans in our liability law ?
we would like you to evaluate the reports which you receive impartially .
we also need to think about the way in which liability is statute-barred .
at present , if I remember the figures correctly , we are not yet even quite at 6 % , but at 5.4 % .
here we can clearly see from empirical studies that network access is by far the best way to achieve high percentages of renewable energy rather than the other methods that have been undertaken in those countries .
yet the studies in my home region have demonstrated considerable potential for renewable projects : wind , including offshore , small hydro , landfill gas , waste incineration , biofuels and photovoltaics .
in any event , as you know , on 2 December 1999 , in the Energy Council , I gave a questionnaire to the Member States , so I could see what stage we had reached , what stage the issue had reached , and so I could present a directive that could obtain sufficient consensus to quickly conclude its passage through both Parliament and the Council .
the question on quite a few people &apos; s lips is : what is to become of this report ?
the Council can not accept the creation or existence of such a system which does not respect the laws of the Member States and which violates the fundamental principles aimed at protecting human dignity . I must stress this very firmly .
these measures must be proportional and carefully balanced with regard to other important interests , particularly bearing in mind the need to protect the fundamental rights specified in the European Convention on Human Rights and the operation of the internal market , with the aim of ensuring the development of electronic commerce .
however , I can tell you that the Portuguese presidency , with full respect for the Community mechanisms , will duly inform the European Parliament about future developments in this work .
to conclude , I must say that we fully understand the political concerns underlying this Parliament initiative .
it dealt with data transmission inside Europe , the Schengen Information System and Europol , none of which were really relevant .
Mr President , Mr Gomes for the Council and Mr Liikanen for the Commission this morning have both made very clear statements .
this morning , and in recent days in particular , we have read and heard a lot of allegations .
but today , and in the Citizens &apos; Rights Committee , we have had few real facts because of the secrecy .
we have very tight controls , both independent controls and control that emanates from the Secretary of State with the full consent of the United Kingdom Government .
the European Court of Human Rights took a decision some time ago when they said `` tapping and other forms of interception of telephone conversations represent a serious interference with private life and correspondence and must accordingly be based on a law that is particularly precise .
we shall , in any case , vote in favour of this resolution because the European Parliament must send out a clear signal in this regard .
finally , it must be made unequivocally clear once and for all that our Directive on the Legal Protection of Biotechnological Inventions excludes not only the patentability of the human being , of parts of the human genetic make-up and of interference with the genome , but also forbids the cloning of human beings at all phases of their development .
Mr President , I know that there are to be no votes on the opinions which have been submitted by the various committees .
the Committee voted to remove this section , but it has nonetheless been included by mistake .
as I have said here several times , I do not think the European Union can want to make its presence felt and to be more visible to its people than it has been up to now , whilst , at the same time , turning its back on their difficulties and misfortunes when these occur .
we think that the EU should devote its energies to those problems which the Member States can not solve themselves , that is to say the cross-border issues .
in fact everyone now agrees in acknowledging that the EUR 360 million sought for Kosovo for the year 2000 represents a sum , a godsend for some people , that this region of former Yugoslavia , with ever-growing centrifugal forces at work , is in no position to assimilate .
there is a great risk that , when the time comes , this dubious practice will be claimed by many as an acquired right , and it will therefore constitute an extremely dangerous precedent as far as the farmers of our countries are concerned .
resolution on `` hushkits &apos;&apos; -LRB- B5-0289 @/@ 2000 -RRB-
this is because the engines which the company concerned plans to use have a by-pass ratio of less than three and so would be excluded from EU airspace under the Regulation as it stands .
faced with a planetary phenomenon of migration , we counter it with plans , budgets and information campaigns .
we must not forget that there are many Europeans who feed this scourge of the new millennium
however , I have taken the floor to explain my reasons for voting in this way because I wish to say that , once again , there is something missing .
it is established and legitimate practice in both academic and biopharmaceutical research to genetically manipulate human cells in tissue culture .
by means of this explanation of vote , I want to express my anger and very deep disappointment at the fact that the European Patent Office can deal with a question about life itself in such a totally and indefensibly careless and negligent way .
Madam President , for the past six months to a year , the Committee on Development and Cooperation has been calling on the Commission to do something about the drought in Ethiopia .
the action proposed by the Austrian Government is heading in the right direction , which is that of strengthening the prosecution of anyone deliberately producing , selling , disseminating or owning materials relating to the sexual exploitation of children .
we must bring our attention to bear , however , on the economic poverty of the parents who are led to exploit their own children in order to survive , or the poverty of abandoned and defenceless children who have lost their points of reference , and think this is their only way out of the situation .
in addition to a wealth of information and expertise , it also reflects the criminal underbelly of society , including child pornography .
it can not be right to release from criminal-law liability one of the primary areas where human dignity is violated , particularly taking into account the special need to protect minors .
I therefore welcome this initiative , which was finally put forward so comprehensively by the Austrian Presidency .
it is important that the financial responsibility for refugees be distributed among Member States .
the financial scheme of setting aside 26 million for structural measures whilst keeping ten million in reserve for contingency measures could never lead to the goal which the Commission has in mind , namely an actual spreading of the financial responsibility .
let me ask all comrades and colleagues around this room today to consider the effects of the amendments that could be passed this week , the damage they could cause , the lack of confidence that would surely emerge and the damage it would do to this nascent market .
once again , this amendment has been prompted by a minor scandal , namely the importing of citrus pulp from Brazil contaminated with dioxin .
the scandal taught us that the Commission did not have the means to act forcefully in emergencies .
the fact is , over the years , more and more additives have been used in foodstuffs , in connection , in particular , with the industrialisation of food production .
to assess whether the use of additives is necessary , the Framework Directive lists various accepted objectives .
the fact that the bread sticks together and does not have to be eaten with a spoon because it has broken into a mass of crumbs is particularly important for children with gluten intolerance .
the carrots are pre-packed , so they are labelled and therefore the consumer knows that an additive is being used .
Mr Lannoye mentioned the application of the precautionary principle .
it is planned for our agenda in May .
Commissioner &apos; s Kinnock &apos; s reform paper , which is broad in scope if nothing else , sets off every single alarm bell in the area of financial control .
this direct contract procedure must not catch on and become the predominant procedure .
Mr SeppÃ¤nen addressed it yesterday .
this is also one of the concerns of the rapporteur for this area and I should like to thank you , Mrs RÃ¼hle , for your willingness to include the arguments of the Committee on Development and Cooperation and the Commission in your report and to propose an action plan and also , at this point , to thank Mr Blak for his preparatory work in this area .
the Commission takes the view that Article 37 of the Treaty is the correct legal basis because the most important objective of the proposal is to prevent irregularities in EAGGF Guarantee Section expenditure .
Mrs Schreyer also mentioned it .
it makes no sense in the context of the postponement report , and it is totally nonsensical and hysterical in tone .
in postponing the discharge , we have set out clear points that we expect the Commission to act upon .
the members of the Commission in many cases are not themselves guilty of furthering their own interests , but the officials continue to act as before , and this Commission must take them to task .
I should like to emphasise that there is broad agreement within the Committee on Budgetary Control about postponing the discharge for the most important accounts , and I would thank the rapporteurs for the splendid and painstaking work they have carried out .
therefore we , as a Parliament , should look at each of these cases as it stands .
of course we must . however we must not compare separate issues .
for example , the auditor has not detected any irregularity in Parliament &apos; s budget .
I hope the Commission will take our demands seriously .
we ought avoid particularly vendettas between an institution and individual commissioners .
the Commission has already indicated that it will submit proposals to this effect before the summer .
I do not wish to challenge the compromise which appears in the resolution negotiated between the political groups and the rapporteur .
I agree with Mrs Morgan that maybe we need to reflect on how we discharge budgets in the future .
the Commission then said that it would , of course , reply to the questionnaire , despite the fact that this point was not clarified .
report -LRB- A5-0091 @/@ 2000 -RRB- by Mr Frahm , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , on the proposal for a Council decision creating a European Refugee Fund -LRB- COM -LRB- 1999 -RRB- 686 - C5-0120 @/@ 2000 - 1999 @/@ 0274 -LRB- CNS -RRB- -RRB-
at the moment , this criterion is the weightiest consideration .
Kirkhope report -LRB- A5-0090 @/@ 2000 -RRB- :
the Danish Social Democratic Members of the European Parliament have chosen to vote in favour of the report and fully and wholeheartedly support the initiatives being taken where this is concerned .
the Internet operates across national borders . it is not , therefore , possible for an individual State effectively to contain the spread of child pornography .
it is of the utmost importance to prevent such violations of the rights of individuals and the rights of children and not to confine ourselves to merely reacting .
we are given the explanation that Europe will bring about the synergy that will solve the problem at minimum expense and , as proof , we are told that the new Fund will be a lightweight body , allocated only limited appropriations .
the goals set at the Lisbon European Council are extremely ambitious and give specific mandates to the Commission .
the Commission also made a decisive contribution to this success , for the conclusions are significantly similar to the contents of the preliminary synthesis document which we drew up in preparation for the Council .
the Commission was asked to develop a benchmarking strategy to define best practice and to guarantee both the development of the necessary infrastructures and the availability of the necessary funds .
having said that , these are in danger of being watered down , and the motion for a resolution tabled by the PPE Group and the Liberal Group presents an absolute caricature of this , giving Parliament the opportunity to split along the good old left-versus-right divide , which does not match the observation of the practical policies implemented within the fifteen Member States , and which certainly does not meet the challenges of the future .
the new economy also involves enabling workers , in the event of company restructuring or necessary discussions about the incorporation of technological innovations in companies , to proceed in decent conditions .
there is a challenge in realising the full potential of the e-economy .
Mr President , let me say to Mr McMillan-Scott that a spectre is haunting Europe , the spectre of economic efficiency and one wonders why it is still so evasive despite all the great efforts that liberalism has put into it .
returning to simplification , the SLIM initiative requires a complete revision .
we have to tackle that reform of the Treaty .
the employment situation in Europe seems to be slightly improving .
in addition to the positive aspects of summits such as these , I would also like to make room for some criticism .
the follow-up to the summit should enable the EU to round off its existing relationship with Africa with a high-level relationship covering , in particular , a continental approach to political and security questions as well as economic issues .
we are asking African countries to accord women a larger place in society , but we ought to begin by establishing parity in our own countries .
if we are honest , then we must examine our own motives because , the truth is that a sort of Africa summit would also suit the European Parliament , because dealing with this subject usually means extremely topical and highly dramatic incidents , with conceptional discussions and efforts to find the right perspective generally getting the thin edge of the wedge , if you disregard the fact that Africa is a predominant subject at the ACP assembly .
the fact that , for the first time in history , such a meeting has taken place between the African and European leaders is , of course , an historic event .
we have held lengthy discussions on this summit and on the fact that its effectiveness rested on two pillars : one is the European Union , and the other is the OAU .
as part of our preparations for that meeting I have gone through the bulk of what we are doing on primary education in Africa and I am happy to say that I am in a position to express something positive about what I have seen in the Commission .
it was quite interesting that he openly admitted to me that they are now pursuing a policy of open , honest information on AIDS and HIV , pretty much parallel to what Uganda has been doing with some success .
Mrs Maij-Weggen mentioned that development aid has progressed over the years .
the Helsinki European Council called on us , in the context of development of the Union &apos;s crisis management structures within the ESDP , to set up a mechanism for rapid reaction .
the Commission should mostly be able to act under its own responsibility and if it has to consult Member States it will be on the simplest possible advisory basis .
I repeat : the facility does not create a new instrument .
with our rapid reaction facility one is very often talking about advisors , mediators , observers , customs officials , police officers , and so on .
this facility has to be used not just on a bilateral basis but in helping groups of countries with what are often common political problems , as well as environmental and other problems .
that is unacceptable .
I certainly do not think that is an issue .
I should like to ask him if he is aware that , notwithstanding the implementation of many of the Community programmes , in a recent BBC television programme Newsnight there was clear evidence that there is a systematic breeding programme in Romania in particular , where children are being bred for export and sale .
the fact that something has been broadcast on the BBC does not automatically mean that it is true .
this applied to a sum of around EUR 1 billion in 1999 .
questions to Mr Byrne
however , the Commission has not yet established whether the Swedish authorities are now complying with current EU rules .
the dispute between what I might describe as a courageous private breeder from one Member State and a breeding association in another Member State , reflects shortcomings in implementation by Member States of both the spirit and letter of related Community law , in particular Directive 90 @/@ 427 on zootechnical and genealogical conditions governing intra-Community trade in Equidae .
how are we meant to function in this way ?
hence the importance of holding the screening procedure that is being prepared and the importance of Turkey &apos; s commitment to incorporating the body of Community legislation and also to respecting the Copenhagen criteria .
we are working in the right direction . there are shortcomings , but this right and safe direction is also the only one that will enable the great country that Turkey is to take the appropriate steps for its economic and institutional modernisation and for its complete integration into modern democratic society .
we plan to submit the first accession partnership in the autumn of this year .
the former president of the Turkish human rights association , Akin Birdal , is again under arrest , despite the fact that he requires medical care .
the other and last message is that yes , we have the road-map .
this is why we want to give Turkey the benefit of the doubt .
is that such a drastic step ?
I should like to close by saying that I hope they will not get wind of what I have said here today and include me on this list , because I love Istanbul and I like to go there quite often .
it is not easy to ward off criticism in connection with the financial protocol to the effect that we have not kept our promises to support the modernisation and the restructuring of Turkey financially .
I would like to add two or three minor points .
we have a situation where , for example , conventional farms can be contaminated with GMOs . that means there is no free choice , either for the farmers themselves - and that goes for organic farmers too - or for the consumers , in the long run .
thirdly , the civil liability clause , which is clearly necessary for those who are responsible for the release of these genetically modified organisms which may have effects on health or the environment .
in short , the consumer must at all times be given a choice .
when I made my presentation to Parliament in the autumn I promised that I would make particular reference to GMOs in the White Paper on environmental liability .
the Commission is of the opinion that a horizontal approach is the most efficient way to guarantee a comprehensive responsibility regime for environmental damage .
we wanted the provisions of the regulation to be kept as simple as possible so that they could be applied , and applied as quickly as possible .
the principle of mutual recognition is fundamental .
the EU is expanding eastward , and we all know the capacity and volume of meat and beef production there , for example .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Papayannakis , and Mr Kindermann , the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture , for their constructive contributions to the debate on the draft regulation under discussion .
in the end we would have 15 different national systems , which runs completely counter to the internal market .
as far as medication is concerned , it would be much better to maintain our high veterinary standards , thereby guaranteeing that only safe beef reaches the market .
they are tabled by different members within that group taking different positions and therefore can not possibly be a group position .
thank you , Mr Ribeiro e Castro .
Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen , the two rapporteurs , wish to speak against this motion .
-LRB- Parliament rejected the procedural motion -RRB-
a report is also to be prepared which will be submitted to the Feira European Council . the Council presidency considers that this report should not be purely theoretical but should also make practical proposals .
the study of possible amendments to the Treaty in respect of the Court of Auditors , the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions has also been started .
the argument put forward in favour of a prudent approach to the inclusion of new items on the agenda concerned the risk , inherent in the technical complexity of this debate , of causing the deadline of this December for the completion of the IGC &apos; s work to be missed .
this is a truly historic moment , as has been stressed .
in this process Parliament &apos; s responsibility is very great indeed .
the effectiveness of democratic institutions is not measured either with a stopwatch , or according to the number of decisions taken . it is measured by the degree of legitimacy .
it is a question of finding a balance between democracy and efficiency and of maintaining the historic balance between small and large countries .
in addition to the massive increase in supranational forms of decision-making , the proposal contains quite a few qualitative changes in the direction of federalism , among these the proposal to remove the national right of veto in the course of changes to large parts of the current Treaty and , also , the demands for a single EU constituency in the elections for the European Parliament .
the loss of an automatic right to nominate a Commissioner would certainly be a very difficult , if not impossible , proposal to sell to an Irish electorate in this referendum .
after all , a house built on sand has no solid foundations .
regarding the enlargement issue , the fact that Member States joining the EU can become fully-fledged Members of the Union should be central .
President , Commissioner , we are faced with a fundamental difficulty , in the exercise in which we are involved , in maintaining the balance between enlarging the EU and reforming the institutions to make that enlargement possible .
I do not think that is a very fair reflection on the extraordinary reforms that many of the candidate countries have made in the last 9 and 10 years since they were within the Warsaw Pact or formerly part of the Soviet Union .
unanimity voting must apply to decisions of a constitutional and fundamental nature .
that is something which the parties of European Free Alliance have in common and our votes will be cast in that light .
-LRB- The President declared the common position approved -RRB-
-LRB- Parliament adopted the legislative resolution -RRB-
the Commission is unable to accept Amendments Nos 5 to 7 , 10 , 12 to 16 , 18 , 20 to 23 , 25 to 28 , 30 to 34 , 39 to 45 , 50 and 51 .
it seems to me that , normally , when the sitting resumes and we resume the vote after a formal sitting , a bell sounds to warn our colleagues that the sitting and the vote are resuming .
paragraph G is inaccurate .
our real goal must be to plan and give our support to the successful implementation of these funds to improve the life prospects of people in our poorest regions .
Mr President , I want to give an oral explanation of vote because what has happened , once again , is not very good news for our Parliament .
instead , it adopted much weaker amendments that express the hope that , in the future , general legislation will be adopted in relation to environmental liability and that call on the Commission to submit a proposal on the impact of biotechnology on all areas over which the European Union has jurisdiction .
the pressure groups in the biotechnology industry explain that there is no risk , while at the same time saying that compulsory insurance is impossible because the risk is not insurable .
David Bowe &apos; s report is yet further proof of Europe greening up its act and putting the safety of our citizens first .
the reason why France chose this option is that the Community institutions are not always able , at this point in time , to ensure real traceability of food products .
in fact , a new wave of neo-liberalism swept through Lisbon and gave the EU its marching orders in the global economic war .
like the EU-Africa civil society Forum in March , which brought together more than 80 NGOs , we declare our opposition to the structural adjustment programmes and our continued support for the debt-cancellation campaigns .
in changing size , the European Union will change in nature .
equally , in the case of the Commission , let us avoid making numbers into an absolute principle .
it is therefore important that it should be possible to conclude the Intergovernmental Conference before the end of the year .
firstly , many speakers discussed the question of the equilibrium between what are termed the large and the small states .
there were representatives from ECHO , the Directorate-General for Development and the Member States of the European Union .
we are looking urgently for alternatives , including better use of the Port of Berbera through rapid improvements to the road from Berbera into Ethiopia .
we give our whole-hearted backing to the efforts of all of those , including the OAU and the European Presidency &apos; s Special Envoy , Ambassador Serri , who worked for a peaceful settlement to regional conflicts .
who will ensure that all these tasks are carried out promptly and efficiently ?
as with other comprehensive agreements , we therefore hope to be able to establish interim agreements covering the period between the signature and ratification of these agreements , bearing in mind that normally almost twenty months pass between these two events .
we have to spend money with those stabilisation and association countries which are negotiating seriously with us on the road to Europe .
will the Council say whether it intends to raise with the Turkish government the issue of the arrest and sentencing of democrats merely for making statements and to demand , as part of the pre-accession procedure , that Turkey give guarantees regarding unrestricted freedom of expression and allow all political parties to be founded and function without hindrance ?
it is clear in this respect that the EU has already indicated its concern to the Turkish authorities , through the appropriate channels , about his status and in particular his return to prison .
if we do that we will certainly not be more moral , we will be more sincere and in that case we can all put our time to better use instead of play-acting as we are all doing now .
the Member should realise that this process of progressive approximation is resulting in greater attention being paid than in the past by the European Union to Turkey &apos; s internal situation and to the way in which this country acts with regard to the requirements imposed by the international community .
instead of the ` multi-ethnic &apos; Kosovo which had been the UN &apos; s objective , we have a situation in which the refugees have failed to return , ethnic cleansing has continued , but now directed at the Serb population , partition has taken root and the dispatch of increasing numbers of new military and police forces is considered ` indispensable &apos; .
however , we must realise that the international community is doing its best .
this is very probably what is needed in Kosovo , who knows for how long , but hopefully for the shortest time possible .
given that UNMIK and its head , Bernard Kouchner , do not act of their own accord , but under international supervision in which the Council is also involved , the latter should scrutinise their actions more closely where they affect the interests of European undertakings , if it wishes to avoid raising doubts about its intentions though the answers it gives .
the question raised has never been submitted to the Council of the European Union , particularly by the undertakings which are complaining .
Mr SeppÃ¤nen , your question indicates that you are clearly confused , unless there has been an interpreting error .
having exhausted this recourse to the Greek courts , there would always be recourse to the Court of Human Rights .
does this also apply to Turkey which has , of course , applied for membership ?
if we were to intervene in a case like this , we would clearly be transposing to the Community dimension an issue for which there is a whole range of recourse in a country which fully respects human and citizens &apos; rights .
we have no doubt , Mr President , that it will take account of the very serious concerns our Parliament expressed by an overwhelming majority , on 3 February last .
existing legislation , however , prohibits or hinders this type of cash management technique .
the world of banking has already driven this problem home to you on numerous occasions .
the euro has stabilised economic development and provided better opportunities to reduce the costs of acquiring capital , something which benefits both companies and private households .
policy and legislation should make provision for e-commerce without creating unnecessary barriers .
an example of this can be found in an area as apparently banal as urban transport .
Mr President , on behalf of our Group I should like to warmly welcome Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi &apos; s excellent report .
the promised dialogue between the Commission on the one hand and business and citizens on the other is to be welcomed because the relationship between the Commission , the European Parliament and society should , after all , be interactive .
I like this metaphor because it is true that European citizens have the feeling that this internal market is already in place . they take it for granted and do not give it any further thought .
we have seen how two different foreign languages have twice been proclaimed the official language ; only at the beginning of last century did our language , Finnish , become the official one .
ladies and gentlemen , there is a considerable amount of work to be done , but it is exciting .
as any expert knows , the estimations in accordance with ESA 95 require breakdowns which affect no less than 60 accounting categories .
here I would like to thank all my colleagues very warmly for their effective cooperation on this issue , and Mr Westendorp and Mr FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n for their excellent work too .
has the Commission decided to begin the reform of the common agricultural policy with a reform of the COM in bananas ?
to adopt the report as it is could result in a strong reaction from our trading partners , as it does not even include the possibility of talks to ease access to the market .
that is why the majority of the ELDR Group supports the Commission &apos;s proposal to continue a tariff-rate quota system for a transitional period before moving to a definitive tariff only system .
it gives complete priority to the concerns of EU banana producers over the equally legitimate concerns of innocent EU businesses in other sectors suffering from arbitrary US sanctions .
this would be an undignified act of foot-dragging which would do nothing to address the long-term issues at stake .
so I hope our Parliament will follow the Committee on Agriculture , and the European Commission will feel obliged to make new proposals to us , more in accordance with European interests and our cooperation with the ACP countries .
those Member States who want to continue with these restrictions have to recognise that they are partly to blame for the current situation , because they have quite simply forgotten to make structural changes in the field of banana production .
failure on this sensitive banana issue would be an admission of weakness on the part of the European Union and would represent a very strong and rousing signal , exploited by all opponents of the common agricultural policy to oppose the social , family and multi-functional agricultural model .
in my opinion , the European Commission has given in to such measures , incapable of recognising the regional agricultural reality and diversity of the countries of the Union and the need for a genuine policy of solidarity and cooperation with the ACP countries which , until recently , were colonial territories of countries which now form part of the Union .
Mr President , it is important for this House to approve Mr Dary &apos; s report , as the Commission proposal to introduce a tariff only system for banana imports by 2006 is unacceptable .
by infringing them and thus triggering sanctions , we are already blocking access to the major US markets - and also increasingly to Latin America &apos; s markets - for whole sectors of our economy .
our vote will also express our rejection of any compromise with the United States that would sacrifice the Community and ACP producers to the profit of the dollar banana .
the Commission &apos; s proposal is too similar to the proposal of the Council of Ministers , which does not consider it necessary to allocate part of the budget to a policy of cooperation and protection of the Community &apos; s primary producers in accordance with WTO negotiations .
on the other hand , this requires agreement with interested parties on the management of tariff quotas during the transitional period .
Madam President , Mr BarÃ³n Crespo , Chairman of the Socialist Group , also directed a comment to me .
Madam President , I tabled this amendment , along with 37 colleagues from the European People &apos; s Party , because I was appalled at the way the media had exploited the explanatory statement which , as everyone should know but obviously does not , is the responsibility of the rapporteur and in no way commits the House .
I put the question to Parliament .
Mr President , I would have been tempted to follow the example of Mr Cox and abstain from the vote on Mrs Stauner &apos; s report , but , in all honesty , I have to say that before I left to come to Strasbourg , some pensioners asked me what I was going to do here .
that is clear .
we have had to conclude that , contrary to our expectations , the power of the large states will increase and the power of the European Parliament and the possibility of our regions being represented within it , will decrease .
it was very important for us to have an opportunity to say whether nuclear weapons play a role of any kind in the future of the common , foreign and security policy .
we are open to discussing increased use of qualified majority voting , although we do not consider that it should be the rule .
these discussions are far from complete , and we do not think that the European Parliament should table amendments to the Treaty before the outcome is known .
above all , it leads to the policy of a pyromaniac fireman in the Balkans , where all the political , social and environmental consequences still have to be reckoned up .
unanimity can not be limited to constitutional decisions . it is completely unrealistic and utopian to think that the members of national parliaments will ratify a treaty which contains such dismantling of their rights , as useless as it is unacceptable , and such a veritable castration of the national parliaments .
this is important from a democratic perspective in view of the fact that , in this way , the voting clearly reflects the will of the people .
but if it opts for the proposals contained in the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report , this will suggest that it is becoming increasingly remote from the people it is supposed to represent .
this is required if it is to be possible to mirror the political breadth and diversity in each Member State .
I would mention , too , that only two members of the Security Council voted for it , against the advice of the three other members who abstained .
-LRB- B5-0340 @/@ 2000 -RRB- by Mr Belder and Mr Van Dam , on behalf of the EDD Group , on the Jews persecuted in Iran ;
with strong feeling all over the world , including in Strasbourg today , the international pressure has had some impact because the Iranian leaders have softened their position , in particular announcing that most of the accused would no longer be appearing on the charge of espionage , tantamount to execution . three have been freed on bail .
finally , the court announced this morning that the trial was being adjourned until 1 May , which is a step forward , at least .
we also demand that observers be permitted to attend the trial , because public hearings are fundamental to holding a fair trial .
akin Birdal is a gentle and peaceful man .
Mr President , once again we protest and call upon the Turkish Government to release a prisoner who is guilty of the desire to live in a country where democracy , rights and freedom are truly respected .
Mr President , you could say that there is something of a feeling of helplessness in standing here yet again and talking about the death penalty in the USA , since it is certainly not the first time we have discussed it , not even the first time during my short period in Parliament .
on a planetary scale , that barbarity condemns millions of human beings to die of hunger or disease when they could easily be cured - but they are not cured because they do not get the medicine they need .
Zimbabwe is a country which , since independence in 1980 , has steadily chosen the path of peaceful development under the leadership of President Mugabe .
I hope that nothing whatsoever is done to put an abrupt end to this .
we will doggedly continue to raise the case of Tibet with the Chinese authorities .

we had the impression that the elections in Taiwan were marked by a mature awareness of democracy amongst the population .
we call on both Beijing and Taipei to take the path of dialogue as quickly as possible .
so I am convinced that other initiatives , especially aid to youth associations , should be massively encouraged and financially supported by the European Union .
this statement is thoroughly valid for lesser-used languages .
I am glad the European Parliament and the Council have agreed to make 2001 the European Year of Languages .
so , from primary school and kindergarten , children should be encouraged to start learning languages , as an instrument to raise awareness of cultural diversity .
opening up to other cultures and finding out about the traditions of our European neighbours are essential ways of combating intolerance and racism engendered by fear of the unknown .
-LRB- NL -RRB- Mr President , we not only voted with enthusiasm for this report , but also for the amendments that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development tabled .
preference should indeed be given to a tariff only system because this option respects the trading flows best and is most clearly WTO compliant .
.
that does not come entirely within the budget , but the reality is such that , in view of the change in the dairy market , this small difference could also perhaps be found in the dairy budget .
that role finds particular resonance in this age of eating disorders and unhealthy diets .
one thing which amazes me , especially when the agricultural community and dairy farmers are going through such difficult times , is that people are prepared to buy many other products and pay substantial amounts of money for them , but they are not prepared to pay the same amount of money for milk , either for themselves , or for their children .
it is totally wrong from a nutritional point of view and it is impossible to administer .
the main question here is , how can we operate as efficiently as possible with the limited resources of the European Union ?
the Commission is the European competition authority par excellence and everyone and certainly legal security will benefit if it explains its new policy in detail beforehand .
first of all , many thanks to you , Mrs Thyssen , for your excellent report .
that concludes the debate .
-LRB- More than 32 Members rose in support of this request -RRB-
I would ask you , Mr President , to remember this and not to allow any MEP to leave the chamber while a count of those Members present is taking place .
the point which is currently on the agenda , night flights , gives us the chance to carry out a roll-call vote .
I also have people behind my desk who help me in this activity .
enlargement to include the countries of Eastern and Central Europe is the biggest challenge in the Community &apos; s history , and if we do not tackle the issue correctly now , we are putting a lot at risk .
it is the Commission &apos; s local offices , in cooperation with Parliament &apos; s local offices , which must meet the man on the street , the man who always thinks that Brussels is so extremely far away .
enlargement , the Commission &apos; s ambitious 5-year plan , the Commission &apos; s plans for reform , the Intergovernmental Conference : there is a lot to provide information about , and I think that this is an urgent matter .
even if you have a first-class product , if you do not market it properly it will not sell .
we must make more and better use of it .
it is a point about openness , about being ready to communicate what is going on and about informing people how seriously we take rights arising from Community law and how seriously we take the need to demonstrate to our citizens and our public the importance of what is accomplished here .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I would like once again to point out that Commissioner Reding has announced a dramatic change in the information strategy of the EU and has thus made it clear that there are deficiencies , that fresh efforts must be made and that we must make this issue a focus of our concerns .
the homework which we have to do we must do ourselves and we must not confuse information and communication within the framework of our work with self-promotion .
that is how it was , Mr MacCormick - he is no longer here .
I made no contribution to this morning &apos; s debate and , with your permission , I would like to say a few words now regarding the vote .
